EphyraQuestionAnalysis
======================

A collection of [OpenEphyra](http://sourceforge.net/projects/openephyra/) components necessary for question analysis.
This was created for OAQA members. We pull some JARs from the OAQA repository. These JARs can also be found in the original OpenEphyra distribution. Many of them come (alas) without any source code.
